# ProfanityDetector
This project provides a Flask-based API for detecting profanity in text using a machine learning model. It uses an SVM model trained on a dataset of toxic comments and leverages a TF-IDF vectorizer for feature extraction. Additionally, a second-stage filter is incorporated to refine predictions and reduce false positives.

This is specially designed to be integrated as a feature in a chatting app to automate the "Report Message" functionality.
